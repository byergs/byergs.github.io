# Ben's Data Projects

## [Student Grade Map](insert link here)

### Excel | SQL | Tableau

Building administration wanted to explore new ways to quickly identify incoming freshman students that are likely to struggle. In addition to standardized test data and teacher recommendations, I wanted to visualize freshman student failures by address to look for patterns in where struggling students typically live.
 - Student Grade and address data was taken from the school's Student Information System (SIS) and exported to Excel
 - Data was cleaned in Excel to remove null values, duplicate records, etc.
 - GPS coordinates were linked to student addresses and number of failed courses for each student were calculated in SQL Server
 - Data visualized in Tableau
