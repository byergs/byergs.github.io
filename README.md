## [Student Grade Map](https://github.com/byergs/Student-Grade-Map-Project)

### Excel | SQL | Tableau

Building administration wanted to explore new ways to quickly identify incoming freshman students who are likely to struggle. In addition to standardized test data and teacher recommendations, I wanted to visualize freshman student failures by address to look for patterns in where struggling students typically live.
 - Student Grade and address data was taken from the school's Student Information System (SIS) and exported to Excel
 - Data was cleaned in Excel to remove null values, duplicate records, etc.
 - GPS coordinates were linked to student addresses and the number of failed courses for each student was calculated in SQL Server
     * Student address coordinates were randomly adjusted to protect privacy
 - Data visualized in Tableau
